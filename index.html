There are 3 devils and 3 mans.<br>
They all have to cross a river in a boat.Boat can only carry max two people at a time.<br>
As long as there are equal number of devils and mans,then devils will not eat mans.<br>
If the number of devils are greater than the number of mans on the same side of the river then devils will eat the mans.<br>
So how can we make all the 6 peoples to arrive to the other side safely?
